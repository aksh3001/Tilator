## Notes

This GIF briefly describes the functioning of the Tilator App. This App calculates the tip amount for three predefined tip percentages. There is also the option to change the default tip values so that the next time, the default tip percentage is automatically loaded.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1.	I accidentally landed into the internal class of SettingsViewController to which I was not able to ctrl-drag any of the objects. Later I realized I had to bring in the SettingsViewController under the Tilator app.
